# Cars.ie Project

This project was initially an assignment given by my data visualizations course. The original goals for this assignment was to build a webscraper in Python to store car data from a website we chose. Then, using this data stored in a database (SQLite), create a Flask web app that will allow CRUD operations and visualize them.
I quite enjoyed doing this assignment and decided to improve it:

## Goals

- [x] Make the scraper non-blocking (multi-threaded).
- [x] Rebuild the web app using SvelteKit. (WIP)
- [ ] Dockerize all the services.
